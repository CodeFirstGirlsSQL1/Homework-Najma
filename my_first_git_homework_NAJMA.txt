Question 1 
Complete definitions for key Git & GitHub terminology GIT WORKFLOW FUNDAMENTALS 
•	Working Directory – it’s a single checkout of one version of the project
•	Staging Area – a rough draft area, you can add the next version of your project
•	Local Repo (head) – this is the repository where we make the local changes, and this is usually on your computer
•	Remote repo (master) – this is the repository that is on the internet or another server
WORKING DIRECTORY STATES: 
• Staged – is one where you can continue making changes to the working directory
• Modified – as you edit files, Git sees them as ‘modified’ because they’ve been changed since the last commit
• Committed – this is when the Git command line will state that the working directory is ‘clean’. This means that all the changes we have made to the repository have been committed.
GIT COMMANDS: 
•	Git add – add a file as it looks to your next commit
•	Git commit – commit your staged content as a new commit snapshot
•	Git push – transmit local branch commits to the remote repository branch
•	Git fetch – fetch down all the branches from that Git remote
•	Git merge – merge a remote branch into your current branch to bring it up to date
•	Git pull – fetch and merge any commits from the tracking remote branch
